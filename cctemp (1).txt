4.	When the installation is complete, reboot the system.
Step 4:  KVM Related Packages in Ubuntu
1.	Once Ubuntu is installed, log in to the system.
 
2.	Open a Terminal in Ubuntu and execute the following commands to check if your system supports virtualization:
sudo grep -c "svm\|vmx" /proc/cpuinfo
o	svm: AMD processors.
o	vmx: Intel processors.
If the output is greater than 0, your CPU supports virtualization.
 
3.	Install KVM and related packages by running the following commands:
1.	sudo apt update

         Practical No. 10

Aim: Study and implementation of Role Based Access Control in AWS Cloud

Steps:
Step1: Open your browser and visit the AWS Free Tier Sign-Up page 👉 https://aws.amazon.com/free > Click on "Create an AWS Account".
Step2: Enter Your Details:
1.	Account Information
2.	AWS Account Name [MyCloudLearning]
3.	Choose Account Type
4.	Payment Information
5.	Verify Your Identity
6.	Choose a Support Plan [Free Basic Plan]

Step3: Sign in to AWS Management Console, Once logged in, ensure that you are in the correct AWS region (top-right corner).
Step4: Type "IAM" and click on IAM under Services > Roles > Create Role 
 step5: Select AWS Service & choose EC2 as the trusted entity > Next   [select role type] 

 \
Step6: Select the AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess checkbox >  Next
Step7: Enter a meaningful role name, [S3_ReadOnly_Role] > Create Role at bottom of page

 You have successfully created an IAM role. Now, you can attach this role to an EC2 instance or other AWS services.

Step8: In EC2 Dashboard, click on Instances (left side panel) > (blue)Launch Instances.  [Launch EC2 Instance]

Step9: Configuring EC2 Instance by selecting below things:

1.	Name Your Instance under Name and Tags [MyTestEC2]
2.	Scroll down to Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image - AMI) > Choose Amazon Linux 2023 (Free Tier eligible)     (will install amazon linux)
3.	Under Instance Type, select t2.micro OR  t3.micro (Free Tier eligible)
4.	Under Key pair (login), click Create new key pair [MyEC2Key] > RSA as (key type) > Create Key Pair and download the .pem file.
5.	Under Network Settings, leave the defaults & make sure Allow SSH traffic is enabled so you can connect to the instance.
6.	Under Configure Storage, keep the default 8 GiB (General Purpose SSD - gp3).


Step10: Now, you will attach the IAM role you created (S3_ReadOnly_Role) to the EC2 instance by scroll down to Advanced Details >  IAM Instance Profile (dropdown) > select S3_ReadOnly_Role > Launch Instance
 

Once the instance is launched, verify that the IAM role is attached

Step11: EC2 Dashboard → Click Instances (left panel) > find launched instance > click on it & open its details > In Details tab, look ‘IAM Role field’ it should show S3_ReadOnly_Role 

 

If the IAM role is displayed correctly, your EC2 instance has IAM permissions attached successfully.
Step12: Now, let’s connect the role to the instance and accessing S3:
1.	Under Instance Details, find the Public IPv4 address  and copy it 
2.	Open Command Prompt, run the command “ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip”
Replace ‘your-key.pem’ → Path to your downloaded key file
                ‘your-ec2-public-ip’ → The public IPv4 address of your EC2 instance  >  Yes

Step13: Test S3 Read-Only Access as we are connected to instance, follow below steps:
1.	Run this command to list all S3 buckets in your AWS account [aws s3 ls]  -  It will successfully read the command 

Step14: Test S3 Modify Access by creating a new S3 bucket type this command [aws s3 mb s3://my-new-bucket]
You should get a permission denied error, confirming that the role only allows read access
